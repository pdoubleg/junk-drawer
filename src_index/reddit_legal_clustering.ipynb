In [[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2xzeee/advice_on_steps_i_can_take_to_protect_my_idea_ie/)], an individual sought advice on protecting their computer program/app idea when discussing it with potential collaborators. The suggestions included obtaining a patent and entering into non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with collaborators. These measures can be relevant in the current scenario to protect the video game concept and 3D models.\n",

Additionally, they can seek advice from an intellectual property attorney to navigate the legal complexities involved in protecting their intellectual property across different states and countries.\n",

      "## Model Response:\n",
      "In order to address the new query, we can draw comparisons to several past cases that involve hiring independent contractors and protecting intellectual property.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, in [[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ea7t71/what_are_my_best_steps_to_form_a_business/)], an individual is seeking guidance on forming an LLC and understanding the different types of business entities. While the new query does not specifically mention forming a business entity, it may be beneficial for the game designer to consider forming an LLC to protect their personal assets and establish a legal framework for their business. This can provide a level of protection for both the game designer and the independent contractors they hire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, in [[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gphir8/looking_to_outsource_work_to_a_foreign_friend_how/)], an individual is seeking clarification on whether their friend, who will be providing video editing services, should be classified as an independent contractor or an employee. This case highlights the importance of properly classifying the relationship between the game designer and the independent contractors they hire. It is crucial to determine whether the contractors should be classified as employees or independent contractors, as this can have implications for tax obligations and legal responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, in [[8](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/519rgb/basing_my_startup_on_an_idea_while_consulting_for/)], a software developer is concerned about potential legal action from a previous client if they launch a startup that incorporates similar concepts. This case emphasizes the need for the game designer to protect their intellectual property. They should consider having the independent contractors sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to ensure that their game concept and 3D models remain confidential and cannot be used or disclosed without permission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, in [[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/51psea/kickstarter_for_a_tabletop_rpg_book_do_i_need_an/)], an individual is planning to launch a Kickstarter campaign for their tabletop RPG book and is unsure if they need to form an LLC. This case highlights the potential benefits of forming an LLC to protect personal assets and limit liability. While the new query does not specifically mention a Kickstarter campaign, it is relevant to consider the potential financial risks and legal protections associated with crowdfunding.\n",
      "\n",
      "By referencing these past cases, the game designer can gain insights into the steps they can take to protect their intellectual property and ensure that the independent contractors they hire are properly classified and compensated. They should consider forming an LLC, having contractors sign NDAs, and consulting with an attorney who specializes in intellectual property and contract law to address the specific legal considerations of hiring contractors from different states or countries.\n",
