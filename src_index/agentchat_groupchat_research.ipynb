If it's the former, this is not a standard practice and it's not clear how it would help resolve the errors. If it's the latter, this is also not a standard practice and could lead to unnecessary delays. Instead, the code should be debugged to understand and fix the errors. If the errors are due to rate limits or similar issues, then it would be appropriate to add a delay in the code, but this should be done in a way that is responsive to the specific error, rather than a fixed 10-minute delay.\n",
