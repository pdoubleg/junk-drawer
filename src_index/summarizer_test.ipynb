I had it towed to GM dealership to have it checked out and they said engine and tranny were both bad and would need replaced. they called warranty company to submit claim and found out the warranty I had bought was never available for that car since it had more than125,000 miles on it.

      "So my friend is currently attending a very small alternative high school after goin through tough times  at her normal high schools. For the sake of privacy I’ll call my friend Cleo. So for her 2020 goal she decided that it she wanted to focus on her mental health and herself for this year and decided to cut out the toxic people in her life. In this process, she cut out a former friend in the same high school, I’ll call her Anna. So she texts Anna and tells her that she thinks they shouldn’t be friends anymore and says something on the lines of “Ive never really felt comfortable with the people you were hanging out with and I’ve felt sometimes you were being disrespectful to me and I felt bothered by your racist jokes and I think it would be better for us if we weren’t friends anymore”. To which they responded something like “you’ve(Cleo) been disrespecting us and you treat us like garbage” and “we do everything for you and we’ve always been there for you”. When in actuality, they’ve been treating Cleo as their personal assistant and has been using her this whole time for weed and as a source for nicotine and drugs. She also reflected back every point they made with facts and evidence and in the end they became very defensive and upset. During their whole conversation Cleo was never disrespectful and never insulted them. \n",
      "When Cleo went back to school, Anna was caught ditching to which she said “Im too mad to be in the same building as Cleo”. The same day as Cleo was leaving, the bus left without her, even though the kids on the bus knew that Cleo also takes the bus and they saw her in school. After telling her teachers the next day, it still happened. This stopped on the third day when her sister called the school. As most of the kids on the bus are Anna’s friends, Cleo thinks this is because Anna has been talking shit behind her back. When In school the other kids talk shit behind her back and are being gorgonic shitheads. \n",
      "Another thing I should add was when Anna and Cleo used to be friends they were in the same group of friends that used to make bad decision. For examples they used to smoke weed and come back to school high. So for 2020 and to better herself, Cleo left the group. When Cleo was talking to the teacher she also told them about their secret stashes and how they came to school high and also about the shit talking. However her school does not seem to care and aren’t really taking action. They also have a private group chat in which they talk shit about other people which Cleo has left. \n",
      "Also I apologize for going 📈📉📈📈📉 but I didn’t know where to start the story. \n",
      "So her question to reddit was is there any legal action to get them in trouble and what they deserve or is there really nothing we can do?\n"

       "## New Query:\n",
       "   I won a small claims case against a used car dealer for $2900 for a used 2002 car I bought.  I bought a extended warranty with car, on our way home after purchase vehicle lost oil pressure and hd to be towed home. I called dealer they said no problem that the extended warranty would cover it.  I had it towed to GM dealership to have it checked out and they said engine and tranny were both bad and would need replaced. they called warranty company to submit claim and found out the warranty I had bought was never available for that car since it had more than125,000 miles on it.  Now used car dealer said they are not liable and have to do nothing. I won the small claims case but they have since appealed and I need to know how to answer my appellee respondents brief but I can not find any similar cases or a format to do it in?   Please help          Thank You\n",

       "Extra info: Plaintiff failed to bring a cause of action against defendant upon which relief could be granted. Trial courts erred by failing to afford defendant opportunity to cross examine plaintiff. Court erred judgment to plaintiff record clearly contradicts plaintiff's assertions. Court erred by waiting over 30 months from date of trial to render decision. \n",
       "## Model Response:\n",
       "The new query involves a used car purchase, an extended warranty that was not valid, and a small claims court case that the buyer won but is now being appealed by the used car dealer. The buyer is seeking guidance on how to respond to the appeal.\n",
       "\n",
       "The most relevant case is [[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/51vff6/fl_used_car_scam/)], where the buyer also purchased a used car that turned out to be in poor mechanical condition. The dealer misled the buyer about the car's reliability, and the paperwork provided was inconsistent. However, this case differs from the new query in that it does not involve an extended warranty or a small claims court case.\n",
       "\n",
       "Case [[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gn3br8/lemon_2020_wrangler_settlement_of_2000_with_no/)] involves a leased vehicle with multiple mechanical issues. The buyer was offered a settlement before pursuing arbitration. This case is similar to the new query in that it involves a faulty vehicle and a legal dispute, but it differs in that it involves a leased vehicle, not a used car purchase, and the dispute is about a settlement offer, not a small claims court case.\n",
       "\n",
       "Case [[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/57zb30/car_damage_after_being_towed_could_use_some_advice/)] involves a car that was towed and subsequently experienced mechanical issues. The insurance company denied coverage, citing pre-existing wear and tear. This case is similar to the new query in that it involves a car with mechanical issues and a dispute over who is responsible for the damage, but it differs in that it involves a towed car, not a used car purchase, and the dispute is with an insurance company, not a used car dealer.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, while there are cases that involve elements similar to the new query, such as a used car purchase, mechanical issues, and legal disputes, none of the cases involve the exact combination of a used car purchase, an invalid extended warranty, and a small claims court case that is being appealed.\n",

She and I have always had a special bond and I have taken it upon myself to do most of the child-rearing as her mother has traveled for work and been mostly uninterested in her.\n",
       "About three weeks ago, my wife and I got in a fight about her drug (opioid prescription that lead to heroin) use, and when I told her that I was taking my daughter she revealed to me that my daughter isn’t biologically mine and I wouldn’t have any legal rights to her. \n",

       "I know that family courts often favor mothers, and I am worried that I might lose my precious little girl. I have a great job (100k a year plus benefits) and plenty of family and company support. I do not want my child to live with her mother while she is in the condition she is in. I have proof that her lifestyle is unsafe and unhealthy for my child.\n",
