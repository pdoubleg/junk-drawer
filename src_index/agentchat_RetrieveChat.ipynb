    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Using RetrieveChat for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framwork allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a convesational system for retrieve augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially, `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and  `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implement a different auto-reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.\n",

    "We'll demonstrates six examples of using RetrieveChat for code generation and question answering:\n",

However, in the last three cases, the context with the highest similarity to the question embedding did not contain the required information to answer the question. As a result, the LLM model responded with `UPDATE CONTEXT`. With the unique and innovative ability to update context in RetrieveChat, the agent automatically updated the context and sent it to the LLM model again.
