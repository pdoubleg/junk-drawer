If, at the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy on the damaged building is less than 80% of the full replacement cost of the building immediately before the loss, we will pay the greater of the following amounts, but not more than the limit of liability under this policy that applies to the building: (1) The actual cash value of that part of the building damaged; or (2) That proportion of the cost to repair or replace, after application of any deductible and without deduction for depreciation, that part of the building damaged, which the total amount of insurance in this policy on the damaged building bears to 80% of the replacement cost of the building. To determine the amount of insurance required to equal 80% of the full replacement cost of the building immediately before the loss, do not include the value of: (1) Excavations, footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that support all or part of the building, which are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor; (2) Those supports described in (1) above which are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls, if there is no basement; and (3) Underground flues, pipes, wiring and drains.
