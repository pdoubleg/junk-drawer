Water Damage, which states: \"We do not cover loss to the property contained in a building caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust unless the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through this opening.\" Additionally, Section C. Damage To Property Of Others states: \"We will pay, at replacement cost, up to $1,000 per 'occurrence' for 'property damage' to property of others caused by an 'insured', subject to the limit of liability under the policy and the replacement cost of the damaged part of the building. We will pay no more than the actual cash value of the damage until actual repair or replacement is complete. However, if the cost to repair or replace the damage is both less than 5% of the amount of insurance in this policy on the building and less than $2,500, we will settle the loss as noted in 2.a. and b. above whether or not actual repair or replacement is complete. Furthermore, our limit of liability for personal property usually located at an \"insured's\" residence, other than the \"residence premises\", is 10% of the limit of liability for Coverage C, or $1,000, whichever is greater. However, this limitation does not apply to personal property moved from the \"residence premises\" because it is being repaired, renovated or rebuilt and is not fit to live in or store property in, or in a newly acquired principal residence for 30 days from the time you begin to move the property there. The special limit for each category is the total limit for the coverage. Additionally, Section I of the policy excludes losses caused by ordinance or law, earth movement (including earthquakes, land shock waves, and tremors), nuclear hazard, and intentional loss. It also excludes losses caused by war, government action, and pollution, including losses caused by landslides, mudslides, subsidence, sinkholes, water damage, power failure, neglect, and war. In the event of a loss caused by water damage or power failure, the policy covers property of the following types: personal property, awnings, carpeting, household appliances, outdoor antennas and outdoor equipment, whether or not attached to the structure. The insured must provide proof of loss, including showing the damaged property, providing records and documents, submitting to an examination under oath, and sending a signed, sworn proof of loss. Covered property losses are settled as follows: the terms \"cost to repair or replace\" and \"replacement cost\" do not include the increased costs incurred to comply with the enforcement of any ordinance or law, except to the extent that coverage for these increased costs is provided in E.11. Ordinance Or Law under Section I â€“ Property Coverages.\n",

It also states that the policy will pay up to $2,500 for appliances, carpeting, and other household furnishings in each apartment on the \"residence premises\" regularly rented or held for rental to others. Finally, it states that the policy may be used to cover up to 10% of the limit of liability for increased costs due to the enforcement of any ordinance or law. The policy on water damage for personal property damage does not cover loss to the property contained in a building caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust unless the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through this opening. Additionally, the policy will pay, at replacement cost, up to $1,000 per 'occurrence' for 'property damage' to property of others caused by an 'insured', subject to the limit of liability under the policy and the replacement cost of the damaged part of the building. Furthermore, the limit of liability for personal property usually located at an \"insured's\" residence, other than the \"residence premises\", is 10% of the limit of liability for Coverage C, or $1,000, whichever is greater.

       "The policy on water damage for dwelling damage is outlined in the HO 00 03 10 00 document, page 9, which states: \"We insure for direct physical loss to the property described in Coverage C caused by any of the following perils unless the loss is excluded in Section I â€“ Exclusions. 1. Fire Or Lightning 2. Windstorm Or Hail. This peril includes loss to watercraft of all types and their trailers, furnishings, equipment, and outboard engines or motors, only while inside a fully enclosed building. This peril does not include loss to the property contained in a building caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust unless the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through this opening. However, we do insure for loss caused by mold, fungus or wet rot that is hidden within the walls or ceilings or beneath the floors or above the ceilings of a structure if such loss results from the accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within: (a)A plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler system, or a household appliance, on the \"residence premises\"; or (b)A storm drain, or water, steam or sewer pipes, off the \"residence premises\". For purposes of this provision, a plumbing system or household appliance does not include a sump, sump pump or related equipment or a roof drain, gutter, downspout or similar fixtures or equipment; or (6)Any of the following: (a)Wear and tear, marring, deterioration; (b)Mechanical breakdown, latent defect, inherent vice, or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself; (c)Smog, rust or other corrosion, or dry rot; (d)Smoke from agricultural smudging or industrial operations; (e)Discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants unless the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape is itself caused by a Peril Insured Against named under Coverage C. Pollutants means any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste. Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned or flues, pipes, wiring and drains. We will pay no more than the actual cash value of the damage until actual repair or replacement is complete. Once actual repair or replacement is complete, we will settle the loss as noted in 2.a. and b. above. However, if the cost to repair or replace the damage is both: (1)Less than 5% of the amount of insurance in this policy on the building; and (2)Less than $2,500; we will settle the loss as noted in 2.a. and b. above whether or not actual repair or replacement is complete. You may disregard the replacement cost loss settlement provisions and make claim under this policy for loss to buildings on an actual cash value basis. You may then make claim for any additional liability according to the provisions of this Condition C. Loss Settlement, provided you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the unloading of aircraft, hovercraft, watercraft or motor vehicles. Additionally, the policy does not cover loss resulting from broken glass or safety glazing material, or from a dwelling that has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days. It also states that the policy will pay up to $2,500 for appliances, carpeting, and other household furnishings in each apartment on the \"residence premises\" regularly rented or held for rental to others. Finally, it states that the policy may be used to cover up to 10% of the limit of liability for increased costs due to the enforcement of any ordinance or law (HO 00 03 10 00, page 9).\n",
       "\n",
       "The policy on water damage for personal property damage is outlined in Section I â€“ Exclusions A.3. Water Damage, which states: \"We do not cover loss to the property contained in a building caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust unless the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through this opening\" (HO 00 03 10 00, Section I â€“ Exclusions A.3. Water Damage). Additionally, Section C. Damage To Property Of Others states: \"We will pay, at replacement cost, up to $1,000 per 'occurrence' for 'property damage' to property of others caused by an 'insured', subject to the limit of liability under the policy and the replacement cost of the damaged part of the building. We will pay no more than the actual cash value of the damage until actual repair or replacement is complete. However, if the cost to repair or replace the damage is both less than 5% of the amount of insurance in this policy on the building and less than $2,500, we will settle the loss as noted in 2.a. and b. above whether or not actual repair or replacement is complete\" (HO 00 03 10 00, Section C. Damage To Property Of Others). Furthermore, our limit of liability for personal property usually located at an \"insured's\" residence, other than the \"residence premises\", is 10% of the limit of liability for Coverage C, or $1,000, whichever is greater. However, this limitation does not apply to personal property moved from the \"residence premises\" because it is being repaired, renovated or rebuilt and is not fit to live in or store property in, or in a newly acquired principal residence for 30 days from the time you begin to move the property there. The special limit for each category is the total limit for the coverage (HO 00 03 10 00, Section C. Damage To Property Of Others). Additionally, Section I of the policy excludes losses caused by ordinance or law, earth movement (including earthquakes, land shock waves, and tremors), nuclear hazard, and intentional loss. It also excludes losses caused by war, government action, and pollution, including losses caused by landslides, mudslides, subsidence, sinkholes, water damage, power failure, neglect, and war. In the event of a loss caused by water damage or power failure, the policy covers property of the following types: personal property, awnings, carpeting, household appliances, outdoor antennas and outdoor equipment, whether or not attached to the structure. The insured must provide proof of loss, including showing the damaged property, providing records and documents, submitting to an examination under oath, and sending a signed, sworn proof of loss. Covered property losses are settled as follows: the terms \"cost to repair or replace\" and \"replacement cost\" do not include the increased costs incurred to comply with the enforcement of any ordinance or law, except to the extent that coverage for these increased costs is provided in E.11. Ordinance Or Law under Section I â€“ Property Coverages (HO 00 03 10 00, Section I). \n",

It excludes losses caused by flooding, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind; water or water-borne material which backs up through sewers or drains or which overflows or is discharged from a sump, sump pump or related equipment; or water or water-borne material below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or seeps or leaks through a building, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, swimming pool or other structure. Direct loss by fire, explosion or theft resulting from water damage is covered.\\\\n\\\\nThe policy also states that if the cost to repair or replace the damage is less than 5% of the amount of insurance in the policy and less than $2,500, the insurer will settle the loss without requiring actual repair or replacement. The insurer will pay the actual cash value of the damage until actual repair or replacement is complete, and then will settle the loss according to the cost to repair or replace the damage. Furthermore, if the building is rebuilt at a new premises, the cost described in (2) above is limited to the cost which would have been incurred if the building had been built at the original premises.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, the policy covers loss to watercraft of all types and their trailers, furnishings, equipment, and outboard engines or motors, only while inside a fully enclosed building. This coverage is provided under Section I \\\\u2013 Property Coverages, Peril 2. Windstorm or Hail. To determine the amount of insurance required to equal 80% of the full replacement cost of the building immediately before the loss, the value of excavations, footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that support all or part of the building, which are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor, and those supports described in (1) above which are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls, if there is no basement, and underground flues, pipes, are not included.\\\\n---------------------\\\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the question: \\\\n    What are the differences in how the policy addresses water damage for dwelling damage and personal property damage?\\\\n    Include a list of sources, i.e. TITLE, sub-title, A., 1., a, (1)., in your final answer.\\\\n    \\\\n\", \"stream\": false, \"model\": \"text-davinci-003\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 2775}' message='Post details'\n",

      "The policy covers direct physical loss to the property described in Coverage C caused by water, freezing, theft, vandalism, and mold, fungus, or wet rot. For water damage, the policy specifies that water supply and heat must be maintained for coverage to apply, and that losses caused by mold, fungus, or wet rot must result from an accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire protective sprinkler system. The policy also covers ensuing loss to property described in Coverages A and B, not precluded by any other provision in the policy, caused by fire or lightning, windstorm or hail, and rain, snow, sleet, sand, or dust if the direct force of wind or hail damages the building. The coverage also includes accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire protective sprinkler system, as well as sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system, an air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler system, or an appliance for heating water, and freezing of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler system or of a household appliance, but only if reasonable care has been used. The coverage does not include loss to the system or appliance from which the water or steam escaped, or to sump, sump pump, or related equipment, or roof drain, gutter, downspout, or similar fixtures or equipment. Additionally, the policy covers losses from aircraft, hovercraft, motor vehicles, watercraft, animals, and residences, as well as losses from fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, smoke, aircraft, vehicles, riot, civil commotion, vandalism, leakage from plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and sprinkler systems, falling objects, and weight of ice, snow, or sleet. However, the policy does not cover losses from the construction of a dwelling, property rented to someone other than an insured, trailers, semitrailers, campers, watercraft, and property at another residence owned by, rented to, or occupied by an insured. It also excludes losses on the \"residence premises\" if the dwelling has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days immediately before the loss, except when the breakage results directly from earth movement. Key topics include accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam, sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging, and freezing. Entities include plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler systems, and household appliances.\n",

      "The policy covers direct physical loss to the property described in Coverage C caused by water, including loss to watercraft of all types and their trailers, furnishings, equipment, and outboard engines or motors, only while inside a fully enclosed building. However, the policy does not cover loss to the property contained in a building caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust unless the direct force of wind or hail damages the building causing an opening in a roof or wall and the rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through the opening. The policy also does not cover loss to the system or appliance from which the water or steam escaped, or to sump, sump pump, or related equipment, or roof drain, gutter, downspout, or similar fixtures or equipment. In the event of a loss caused by water damage, the coverage is settled at actual cash value at the time of loss, but not more than the amount required to repair or replace. For buildings covered under Coverage A or B, the coverage is at replacement cost without deduction for depreciation, subject to the limit of liability under the policy and the replacement cost of the damaged part of the building. If the building is rebuilt at a new premises, the cost described in (2) above is limited to the cost which would have been incurred if the building had been built at the original premises. If, at the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy on the damaged building is less than 80% of the full replacement cost of the building immediately before the loss, we will pay the greater of the following amounts, but not more than the limit of liability under this policy that applies to the building: (1) The actual cash value of that part of the building damaged; or (2) That proportion of the cost to repair or replace, after application of any deductible and without deduction for depreciation, that part of the building damaged, which the total amount of insurance in this policy on the damaged building bears to 80% of the replacement cost of the building. To determine the amount of insurance required to equal 80% of the full replacement cost of the building immediately before the loss, do not include the value of: (1) Excavations, footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that support all or part of the building, which are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor; (2) Those supports described in (1) above which are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls, if there is no basement; and (3) Underground flues, pipes, wiring and drains. We will pay no more than the actual cash value of the damage until actual repair or replacement is complete. Once actual repair or replacement is complete, we will settle the loss as noted in 2.a. and b. above. However, if the cost to repair or replace the damage is both: (1) Less than 5% of the amount of insurance in this policy on the building; and (2) Less than $2,500; we will settle the loss. In addition, the terms \"cost to repair or replace\" and \"replacement cost\" do not include the increased costs incurred to comply with the enforcement of any ordinance or law, except to the extent that coverage for these increased costs is provided in E.11. Ordinance Or Law under Section I â€“ Property Coverages. Covered property losses are settled as follows: 1. Property of the following types: a. Personal property; b. Awnings, carpeting, household appliances, outdoor antennas and outdoor equipment, whether or not attached to the building; and c. Trees, shrubs and other plants will be settled at actual cash value at the time of loss.\n",
