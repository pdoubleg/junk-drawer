This coverage is outlined in Section I \\\\u2013 Property Coverages, Coverage C \\\\u2013 Personal Property, under the subsection Covered Property, which states: \\\\\"We cover personal property owned or used by an \\\\\"insured\\\\\" while it is anywhere in the world. After a loss and at your request, we will cover personal property owned by...(5)Mold, fungus or wet rot. However, we do insure for loss caused by mold, fungus or wet rot that is hidden within the walls or ceilings or beneath the floors or above the ceilings of a structure if such loss results from the accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within: (a)A plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic fire protective sprinkler system, or a household appliance, on the \\\\\"residence premises\\\\\"; or (b)A storm drain, or water, steam or sewer pipes, off the \\\\\"residence premises\\\\\". For purposes of this provision, a plumbing system or household appliance does not include a sump, sump pump or related equipment or a roof drain, gutter, downspout or similar fixtures or equipment.\\\\\" (HO 00 03 10 00, Page 9 of 22). Additionally, this coverage also includes the direct physical loss to covered property caused by the pieces, fragments or splinters of broken glass or safety glazing material which is part of a building, storm door or storm window, and the breakage of glass or safety glazing material which is part of a covered building, storm door or storm window when caused directly by earth movement. \\\\n\\\\nThe policy also outlines the coverage for buildings damaged by a loss. It explains that the insurer will pay the actual cash value of the damage until actual repair or replacement is complete, and then will settle the loss based on the cost to repair or replace the damage. It also outlines exceptions to this rule, such as when the cost to repair or replace is less than 5% of the amount of insurance in the policy and less than $2,500. Additionally, the insurer will not include the value of excavations, footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that support all or part of the building, which are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor, those supports described in (1) above which are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls, if there is no basement, and underground flues, pipes, wiring and drains when determining the amount of insurance required to equal 80% of the full replacement cost of the building immediately before the loss.\\\\n---------------------\\\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the question: \\\\n    How does the policy addresses water damage for dwelling damage and personal property damage?\\\\n    Include a bullet point list of citations in your answer.\\\\n    \\\\n\", \"stream\": false, \"model\": \"text-davinci-003\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 3005}' message='Post details'\n",

       "For personal property damage, the policy covers direct physical loss to the property caused by any of the perils listed in Coverage C – Personal Property, such as fire or lightning, windstorm or hail, explosion, riot or civil commotion, aircraft, vehicles, and smoke (Section I – Property Coverages, Coverage C). It does not cover loss to the system or appliance from which the water or steam escaped (Section I – Property Coverages, Coverage C). However, it does cover loss caused by mold, fungus, or wet rot that is hidden within the walls or ceilings or beneath the floors or above the ceilings of a structure if such loss results from the accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire protective sprinkler system, or a household appliance, on the \"residence premises\", or a storm drain, or water, steam, or sewer pipes, off the \"residence premises\" (Section I – Property Coverages, Coverage C). Additionally, it does not cover loss caused by water damage, power failure, landslide, mudslide or mudflow, subsidence or sinkhole, or any other earth movement including earth sinking, rising or shifting, unless direct loss by fire or explosion ensues (Section I – Property Coverages, Coverage C). Furthermore, it excludes loss caused by flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind; water or water-borne material which backs up through sewers or drains or which over-flows or is discharged from a sump, sump pump or related equipment; or water or water-borne material below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or seeps or leaks through a building, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, swimming pool or other structure; caused by or resulting from human or animal forces or any act of nature (Section I – Property Coverages, Exclusions). Additionally, it excludes power failure if the failure takes place off the \"residence premises\" and neglect of an \"insured\" to use all reasonable means to save and preserve property at and after the time of a loss (Section I – Property Coverages, Exclusions). Lastly, it excludes war, including undeclared war, civil war, insurrection, rebellion or revolution, warlike act by a military force or military personnel, or destruction, seizure or use for a military purpose, including the discharge of a nuclear weapon (Section I – Property Coverages, Exclusions). \n",

       "The policy states that water damage to the dwelling on the \"residence premises\" is covered under Coverage A of Section I – Property Coverages. This includes the cost to tear out and replace any part of a building, or other structure, on the \"residence premises\", but only when necessary to repair the system or appliance. The policy also states that losses caused by water damage, such as freezing, theft, vandalism, and mold, fungus, or wet rot, are covered under Coverage A, unless the loss is otherwise excluded. Additionally, the policy states that an accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from a storm drain or water, steam, or sewer pipe off the \"residence premises\" is covered under Coverage A. Furthermore, the policy will pay up to $5,000 for grave markers, including mausoleums, on or away from the \"residence premises\" for loss caused by a Peril Insured Against under Coverage C. The policy also excludes losses caused by water damage, such as flooding, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind, water or water-borne material which backs up through sewers or drains or which overflows or is discharged from a sump, sump pump or related equipment, or water or water-borne material below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or seeps or leaks through a building, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, swimming pool or other structure. Additionally, the policy excludes losses caused by war, communicable disease, or controlled substances. Finally, the policy will pay up to $2,500 for appliances, carpeting, and other household furnishings in each apartment on the \"residence premises\" regularly rented or held for rental to others, and up to 10% of the limit of liability that applies to Coverage A can be used for increased costs due to the enforcement of any ordinance or law which requires or regulates the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of a covered building or other structure, provided the dwelling is used only as a residence, or in part for use only as a residence, or in part, as an office, school, studio or private garage."
