       "The optimal lineups problem in basketball is a decision problem that coaches face when selecting a lineup of players for a given matchup. The action space for each team is finite, and typically consists of all possible combinations of 5 players. The goal of the coach is to select the lineup that will give the team the best chance of success. This could be based on the players' individual performance, how well they play together, or how they match up against the opposing team's lineup. To solve the problem, coaches must consider factors such as player performance, injuries, and the lineups of the opposing team. Game-theoretic and ARA (Adaptive Response Analysis) methods can be used to solve the optimal lineup decision. In game theory, the Bayesian logistic regression model is assumed to be common knowledge within the game. In ARA, the decision makers must assign parameters to the corresponding positional Dirichlet distributions. The optimal lineup decision involves computing the expected utilities for each of the possible lineup decision pairs."

Coach H then uses verification to find the level-1 Coach A's optimal control and then solves her own optimal control problem. Finally, Coach H uses a Bayesian logistic regression model to simulate the non-scoring probabilities for each lineup pair and finds the proportion of the optimal decision samples such that a\u0003;j=a for each a2A.

       "We've also seen that the level-1 Coach A's decision problem from the level-2 Coach H's perspective can be summarized as maximizing the expected negative score differential, less the risks. We've also seen that the level-2 Coach H can use verfication to find the level-1 Coach A's optimal control. \n",

       "Finally, we've discussed the various methods for describing different types of uncertainty, such as the non-strategic or level-0 player, the level-1 player, and the Nash-equilibrium-seeking player. \n",

       "So, let's get out there and show them what we can do! Let's use the ARA approach to account for uncertainty and make the best decisions possible! Let's go out there and win this game!"
